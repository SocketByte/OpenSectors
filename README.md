# OpenSectors ![version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.4-blue.svg) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SocketByte/OpenSectors.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/SocketByte/OpenSectors)

# This project is outdated! 
## Please head to [MinecraftServerNetwork](https://github.com/SocketByte/MinecraftServerNetwork) for the updated and maintained version. 


## Old documentation

OpenSectors allows you to split your world into different servers
using Kryonet and other networking solutions. This plugin splits your
world into few pieces and each piece is different server. Everything
is properly synchronized so it feels like it is one server. It allows you to
have more players playing on one world, because it is actually working
on few servers, so nothing will stop you from having 3000+ players on a single
world!

It also supports basic authentication systems like checking password
during the sector connection. That way people who want to
connect using their own software to **your server** and do something
bad to it, can't do it!

This presentation will be quite long, so here you have quick links to everything.

## How it works / installation?
The project actually contains two projects - linker and system.
Both are really important for everything to work.

You put `OpenSectorLinker` on each of your sectors,
and `OpenSectorSystem` on your BungeeCord (or one of it's forks) server.

Both contain useful configurations, and you should check them!

Remember, you want to unlock port `23904` and `23905` (or other you specify in configuration)
because they're used to send data over the sector network.

## Do I need redis or something similar?
**No**! Absolutely not. It's main advantage over it's competitors
is - no additional libraries or unconventional databases needed. It's just... plug & play.

You just need a MySQL server which is pretty standard today.

## How do I use it with my other plugins?
You need to rewrite them or ask developers to do it for you.
There's no way to make this differently. 70% of plugins need to be
synchronized over the sector network to work properly.

Fortunatelly, `OpenSectors` provide super easy API which
makes this task much easier for end-user.

You can edit existing plugins to make them work with `OpenSectors`
which will require minimal Java and networking knowledge.

**_But!_** I can edit or write plugins which will support `OpenSectors`
for you! You need to contact me directly though.

## Configuration
Configuration is pretty simple. The main problem is to provide
valid coordinates for your sectors. You can use ready to use configuration
below, or create your own. Unfortunatelly, `OpenSectors` don't provide
ANY of location scaling systems or similar currently.

## API
Yes, that's what you wanted, don't ya? :D

API is fairly easy, and with Javadocs/code on github it's even easier.
But I will tell you how to do basic things using `OpenSectors` API system.
API will be definitely richer in the future, remember that!

#### Linker
Add this code to your maven dependencies.
```xml
    <repositories>
        <repository>
            <id>socketbyte-repo</id>
            <url>http://repo.socketbyte.pl/repository/nexus-releases</url>
        </repository>
    </repositories>
    
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>pl.socketbyte</groupId>
            <artifactId>OpenSectorLinker</artifactId>
            <version>1.2</version>
            <scope>provided</scope>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
```
And of course Spigot/Bukkit engine too!
#### System
or this code when you make plugin for system:
```xml
    <repositories>
        <repository>
            <id>socketbyte-repo</id>
            <url>http://repo.socketbyte.pl/repository/nexus-releases</url>
        </repository>
    </repositories>
    
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>pl.socketbyte</groupId>
            <artifactId>OpenSectorSystem</artifactId>
            <version>1.4</version>
            <scope>provided</scope>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
```

There is few types of API calls you can make.
Firstly, I would want you to know about packet catching and sending. It is
very important in the long term. You want to send a lot of packets and data, and catch it!

##### This part of the API (packet sending/catching) is also working on system side!

You can register your own `Packet` extended classes easily,
and send them over the network (and/or catch them in the listener)
It is fairly easy, look;
```java
PacketExtender<PacketExampleTest> packetExtender = SectorAPI.createPacketExtender(PacketExampleTest.class);
packetExtender.setPacketAdapter((connection, packet) ->
        System.out.println("Received PacketExampleTest from the proxy server."));
```
In order this to work, you need to register this class on system plugin too.
```java
SectorAPI.register(PacketExampleTest.class);
```
or just create `PacketExtender` like above.

What is `PacketExampleTest`? It's a class, which extend `Packet` class.
```java
public class PacketExampleTest extends Packet {

    private String test;

    public PacketExampleTest() {

    }

    public String getTest() {
        return test;
    }

    public void setTest(String test) {
        this.test = test;
    }

}
```
Remember, it needs to be absolutely the same on both sides.
Congratulations! Now you can send it using:
```java
PacketExampleTest exampleTest = new PacketExampleTest();
exampleTest.setTest("Hello, World!");
SectorAPI.sendTCP(exampleTest);
```
You can also send UDP packets.
```java
SectorAPI.sendUDP(exampleTest);
```

You can also register something like pub/sub in Redis. What do I mean?
You can register specific channels and send custom payload packet which contain some data.
It is less convinient than using `PacketExtender` but it can be better sometimes.
```java
SectorAPI.registerPayloadChannel("TEST_CHANNEL", (connection, packet) -> {
    System.out.println("Received PacketCustomPayload (TEST_CHANNEL) as a LINKER.");
    System.out.println(packet);
});
```
You can do the same on the system side. (You don't need to register anything!)
Now you can send something, like
```java
PacketCustomPayload customPayload = new PacketCustomPayload();
customPayload.setChannel("TEST_CHANNEL");
customPayload.setData(new Object[] { "Hello", "World!" });
SectorAPI.sendTCP(customPayload);
```

##### This part is only for Linkers (who would want to use it on system side though)
This is... MySQL API! How awesome, right?
Firstly, you need to make a Query packet.
```java
PacketQuery query = new PacketQuery();
query.setQuery("INSERT INTO something VALUES(?, ?)");
```
...set replacements...
```java
query.addReplacement(1, "a nice value");
query.addReplacement(2, "even nicer value");
```
... and send them!
```java
SectorAPI.sendTCP(query);
```
Congratulations, you executed a query on the system side
and now your values are in the global database! Amazing!
But, what if you want a result...? like... `ResultSet`?
It works with this API too!

Make an execute query
```java
PacketQueryExecute queryExecute = new PacketQueryExecute();
queryExecute.setQuery("SELECT * FROM something WHERE fancier=?");
queryExecute.addReplacement(1, "even nicer value");
```
... and!
```java
SectorAPI.sendTCP(queryExecute, packetQueryExecute -> {
    SerializableResultSet resultSet = packetQueryExecute.getResultSet();
    while (resultSet.next()) {
        System.out.println("Received from SQL:  " + resultSet.getString(0)
                + " -> " + resultSet.getString(1));
    }
});
```
You create a query which contains an interface which is your callback.
Confusing, right? Not really, it just returns you a modified packet
with `SerializableResultSet` (something which is similar to real `ResultSet` but cached and serializable)

That's all for the basic API part! You have some other functions but for that
you need to check javadocs!

You can get javadocs here: https://socketbyte.pl/javadocs/

(and select proper project)

### How to make your own database?
The newest API allows you to set the database (like MariaDB, PostgreSQL, OrientDB or SQLite)

How to do it? It is very simple.
Set `useDefaultSql` value in JSON (system) configuration to `false`.

This code needs to be in `onEnable()` of your addon plugin.
```java
HikariMySQL hikari = new HikariMySQL();
hikari.setHost("localhost");
hikari.setDatabase("database");
hikari.setPort(3306);
hikari.setPassword("");
hikari.setUser("root");
hikari.apply();

HikariManager.INSTANCE.connect();
```
Congratulations, you did a standard MySQL connection.
But what about others? I've prepared 4 most popular SQL configurations for Hikari.

Just change the class like this:
```java
HikariMariaDb hikari = new HikariMariaDb();
hikari.setHost("localhost");
hikari.setDatabase("database");
hikari.setPort(3306);
hikari.setPassword("");
hikari.setUser("root");
hikari.apply();

HikariManager.INSTANCE.connect();
```
You can do the same with:
```java
new HikariSQLite();
new HikariPostgreSQL();
```
Remember, SQLite doesn't need port, password or user.
You need only to set database, which is your file name.

What about basic table creation? There's an API for that too!
```java
hikariMySQL.setTableWork(connection -> {
    try {
        PreparedStatement statement = connection.prepareStatement(
                "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS...");
        statement.executeUpdate();
        statement.close();
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
    finally {
        try {
            connection.close();
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
});
```
Simple as that, then activate it by using:
```java
HikariManager.INSTANCE.createBasicTables();
```
You can also create your own database configurations for other SQL distributions.
You can do that in two ways. Do a custom class which extend `HikariExtender`, or use `HikariWrapper`.

#### HikariExtender
Make a class and do `extends HikariExtender`, apply, and set everything.
You can access `HikariDataSource` by using `getDataSource()` and every other
setting using `getPassword()` or `getHost()`.

Example (SQLite class):
```java
public class HikariSQLite extends HikariExtender {
    @Override
    protected void connect() {
        HikariDataSource dataSource = getDataSource();
        String database = getDatabase();

        // Do everything you want here.
        dataSource.setJdbcUrl("jdbc:sqlite:" + database + ".db");
        dataSource.setDriverClassName("org.sqlite.JDBC");
        dataSource.setPoolName("HikariSQLite");
        dataSource.setMaxLifetime(0);
        dataSource.setMaxLifetime(60000);
        dataSource.setIdleTimeout(45000);
        dataSource.setMaximumPoolSize(20);

        Properties properties = new Properties();
        properties.put("driverType", "thin");
        dataSource.setDataSourceProperties(properties);
    }
}
```
#### HikariWrapper
HikariWrapper is a class that allows you to do everything like above,
but without creating a new class. Why? Because you can!

Example:
```java
HikariWrapper hikariWrapper = new HikariWrapper(hikariWrapper1 -> {
    HikariDataSource dataSource = hikariWrapper1.getDataSource();
    
    dataSource.setJdbcUrl("...");
    dataSource.setDriverClassName("...");
});
hikariWrapper.apply();

HikariManager.INSTANCE.connect();
```
More about `HikariCP` here: 

https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP

## Callback system
It's easy to use system for sending, and instantly receiving packets (and doing something with them)
It's based on a simple `Callback<T>` and `CompletableFuture<T>` which makes it really convinient.

Basic usage:
```java
PacketPlayerState state = new PacketPlayerState();
state.setPlayerName("...AnyPlayerName...");
SectorAPI.sendTCP(state, new Callback<PacketPlayerState>() {
    @Override
    public void execute(PacketPlayerState packetPlayerState) {
        // Your callback (information from the proxy)
        
        System.out.println("Sector: " + packetPlayerState.getServerId());
        System.out.println("Is Online: " + packetPlayerState.isOnline());
        System.out.println("UniqueID: " + packetPlayerState.getPlayerUniqueId());
    }
});
```
This system also works on `PacketQueryExecute`.
More packets based on callback system to come soon!

## Task system
There's pretty basic task system, but it allows you to create tasks
which are synchronized over the network, so they're executed simultaneously.

##### Basic task

To create a task, use code below:
```java
SectorAPI.createTask(0, 
        () -> System.out.println("Synchronized task with id:0"),
                0, 1, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
```
The first parameter (`0`) is a task id. Each task 
should have a different one!

Second parameter is a runnable, which is your code.

Then you have (`0`) which is `initialDelay`.

Then is a `period` which is the rate of the task.

And the last parameter is `TimeUnit` which doesn't need much explaining.

##### Singleshot task
There is also a singleshot task system, you can execute a code
simultaneously on all sectors using `task.send()`.

To prepare a singleshot task use: 
```java
SynchronizedTask task = SectorAPI.prepareSingleShot(1,
        () -> System.out.println("Single shot task executed!"));
```
And then send it using
```java
task.send();
```
You can do that as many times as you want.

#### Disclaimer
Remember that if you use task system, you need to install 
your plugin on all sectors.

## Synchronized data types
The new WIP feature of `OpenSectors` API.

It allows you to create synchronized lists or maps over the network.
It's super easy to use because of direct `List<E>` or `Map<K, V>` implementation.

```java
List<String> list = new SynchronizedList<>(0);
Map<String, String> map = new SynchronizedMap<>(0);
```
The parameter is an ID, it needs to be unique for each list/map.
Then, you just use them like normal lists or maps.

Remember, this is a **Work In Progress** feature. It can be bugged, especially maps (!). 

## Wrapp integration
More about wrapp [here](https://github.com/SocketByte/Wrapp).

You can easily integrate Wrapp to OpenSectors. How? Let me explain.

Start with registering an adapter:
```java
WrapperFactory wrapperFactory = new WrapperFactory(); // REUSE THAT
SectorAPI.registerPayloadChannel("MYOBJECT_WRAPP_CHANNEL", (connection, packet) -> {
     PacketWrapper<MyObject> packet = (PacketWrapper)packet;
     Wrapper<MyObject> wrapper = packet.getWrapper();

     MyObject myObject = new MyObject();
     wrapperFactory.read(wrapper, myObject);

     // congratz, your object is now set!
});
```
Then you can send it from `Linker` using:
```java
MyObject objectToSave = new MyObject(); // it's not serializable

WrapperFactory wrapperFactory = new WrapperFactory(); // REUSE THAT
wrapperFactory.register(MyObject.class); // optional to improve speed
Wrapper<MyObject> wrapper = wrapperFactory.write(objectToSave);

PacketWrapper<MyObject> packet = new PacketWrapper<>();
packet.setChannel("MYOBJECT_WRAPP_CHANNEL");
packet.setData(new Object[] { "additional data" });
packet.setWrapper(wrapper);

SectorAPI.sendTCP(packet);
```

## Additional packets
##### PacketItemTransfer *(from 1.1)*
```java
// Create packet
PacketItemTransfer packet = new PacketItemTransfer();
// Set receiver (all == every player on every sector)
packet.setReceiver(Receiver.ALL);
// Set itemstack as SerializableItem
packet.setItemStack(new SerializableItem(new ItemStack(...)));
```
##### PacketSendMessage *(from 1.1)*
```java
// Create packet
PacketSendMessage packet = new PacketSendMessage();
// Set receiver (player == only one player)
packet.setReceiver(Receiver.PLAYER, "uniqueId");
// Set message and it's type
packet.setMessage(MessageType.ACTION_BAR, "&6&lHello, World!");
```
##### PacketPlayerTransfer *(from 1.0)*
```java
PacketPlayerTransfer packet = new PacketPlayerTransfer();
// Set the player
packet.setPlayerUniqueId("uniqueId");
// Set player info (not required)
packet.setPlayerInfo(new PacketPlayerInfo(player));
// Set server id
packet.setServerId(1);
```
##### PacketPlayerTeleport *(from 1.2)*
```java
PacketPlayerTeleport packet = new PacketPlayerTeleport();
// Set player
packet.setPlayerUniqueId("uniqueId");
// Set target (optional)
packet.setTargetUniqueId("uniqueId");
// Or set coords
packet.setLocation(250, 70, 250);
```
##### PacketPlayerState *(from 1.2)*
```java
PacketPlayerState packet = new PacketPlayerState();
packet.setPlayerName("...");
SectorAPI.sendTCP(packet, packetPlayerState -> {
    // do what you want with the callback
});
```

More to come soon!
